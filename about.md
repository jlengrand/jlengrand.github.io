My name **Julien Lengrand-Lambert**, and I am a french 30 year old guy living in **Utrecht, the Netherlands**. I live there for 6 years with my girlfriend and my cat. And at the end of September 2016, I became the father of a little thing that keeps us awake at night and brings us all of the love in the world.

<br>


[My purpose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authentic_leadership) is to *build islands where knowledge turns into value, and nerds are the heroes*.


<br>


I work at [ING](ing.nl) during the day as an **IT Chapter Lead**, and I am responsible for coaching a team of about 15 engineers as well as being an engineer myself. I am also the cofounder of **[Skyai](http://skyai.io/)**, a company where we help people gather insights using images coming from space. We do a lot with sustainability, and in the last months we have been focusing on [ESGs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental,_social_and_corporate_governance).

<br>

I am originally an **Image Processing engineer**, and I used to develop low footprint algorithms on embedded platforms. I also worked in automatic sea mine detection in the past and published papers in conferences.
I love building things, creating performant teams, but most of all solving people's problems. 
During my free time, you can find me **[coding](http://github.com/jlengrand)**, **[organizing meetups](http://www.meetup.com/Saturday-Morning-Coding-Utrecht/)** and **bouldering**. 

<br>




<br>

I try to write blog posts regularly, and be active on **[Twitter](http://twitter.com/jlengrand)** as well; but I must admit that I usually prefer building stuff!


Some of my projects include :

- **[SkyAI](http://skyai.io/)**, a startup that aims at generating sustainability insights for businesses, municipalities and countries using satellite imagery.
- **[ServsUp](http://servsup.co/)**, an open-source, self-hosted status page application written in Node.js
- **[Brestram](http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fr.lengrand.brestram&hl=en)**, an android app that delivers real-time bus schedules in Brest.
- **[Brestram](http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fr.lengrand.brestram&hl=en)**, an android app that delivers real-time bus schedules in Brest.
- **[Computer Vision companies](http://www.lengrand.fr/computer-vision-companies/)**, an evergrowing list that I curate for almost 10 years. I get a lot of emails about it :).
- **[OpenCVPlanet](https://twitter.com/opencvplanet?lang=en)**, a twitter account that gathers blog posts from famous computer vision experts.

<br>

I love solving real problems, and am always searching for the next challenge. **[So feel free to contact me](mailto:julien@lengrand.fr)**, I'd be glad to have a word with you.
