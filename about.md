My name **Julien Lengrand-Lambert**, and I am a french 29 year old guy living in **Utrecht, the Netherlands**. I live there for 5 years with my girlfriend and my cat. And at the end of September 2016, I became the father of a little thing that keeps us awake at night and brings us all of the love in the world.


<br>


I work at [ING](ing.nl) during the day as a **CHapter Lead**, and I am responsible for coaching a team of 8 to 10 engineers as well as being an engineer myself. During my free time, you can find me **[coding](https://github.com/jlengrand)**, **[organizing meetups](http://www.meetup.com/Saturday-Morning-Coding-Utrecht/)** and **bouldering**. I also **[play DOTA2](http://dotabuff.com/teams/1132289) in a team**, and take **[a lot of pictures](http://www.fluidr.com/photos/49365498@N03/sets)** of things around me :).


<br>


I am originally an **Image Processing engineer**, and I used to develop low footprint algorithms on embedded platforms. I also worked in automatic sea mine detection in the past and published papers in conferences.
They can be found here:

In 2012, I have [won a Startup Week-end](http://www.lengrand.fr/2012/12/how-we-won-our-first-startup-weekend/) with people I had just met and spent a lot of time working on **[Brestram](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fr.lengrand.brestram&hl=en)**.
I try to write blog posts regularly, and be active on **[Twitter](https://twitter.com/jlengrand)** as well; but I must admit that I usually prefer fixing bugs!


My latest projects include :


- **[Brestram](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fr.lengrand.brestram&hl=en)**, an android app that delivers real-time bus schedules in Brest.
- **[Spo2tube](http://spo2tu.be/)**, a Spotify to Youtube converter that I developed to learn node.js.
- **[Ivolution](http://jlengrand.github.io/Ivolution/)**, a face timelapse generator written in Python.
- **[ServsUp](http://servsup.co/)**, an open-source, self-hosted status page application written in Node.js
- **[SkyAI](http://skyai.io/)**, a startup that aims at generating sustainability insights for businesses, municipalities and countries using satellite imagery.

I love solving real problems, and am always searching for the next challenge. **[So feel free to contact me](mailto:julien@lengrand.fr)**, I'd be glad to have a word with you.
