Here is something I wanted to do for a long time.

Some time ago, I left France to go international. Since my 6 internship in The Hague, English had become a need and I absolutely wanted to work abroad.

As a computer vision engineer, find a job is both really difficult and very easy. Basically, it is quite easy to get hired, as you are in a specialized field and usually your resume don't get lost around thousands of others.

On the other hand, it can be very difficult to actually find the computer vision related companies. There are loads of them, but mostly small sized.

I started to write the name of each company I could find during my researches, with its main country and its broad specialty (medical, sattelites,  .  . .).

<strong><a title="Computer Vision companies" href="http://www.lengrand.fr/computer-vision-companies/" target="_blank">You will find it here</a></strong>, and It should be updated regularly !

Hope this can help some of you !

By the way, my vision is very small; so feel free to enlight me and help me fill this list ! Let me know if you are aware of companies not listed!
