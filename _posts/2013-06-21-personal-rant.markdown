Once again, I have been way too much silent in here.
There must be a reason why I find writing posts so difficult.

Or maybe it's just because I'm lazy. Probably in fact.
I did reduce my twitter, facebook and Hacker News consumption lately, as I said I would in my last blog post. Sadly, this didn't help much so far.

I still end my days wishing like I had done twice as much. And this is frustrating.
Well, I have developed my very first web app those last weeks, so not everything is black.

But I really got to find the reason why procrastinating is so tempting, where there is still so much to be done in this world. . .
The diet started, but there is still a lot more to be done.
