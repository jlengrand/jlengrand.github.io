Or let me rephrase this : <strong>I AM fat</strong>.

I am fat of all the junk food I eat way too often.
I am fat of all the biers I have where I should drink water instead.
I feel fat sitting in front of the computer all day, when I should exercise.

But I am also fat of all the technical articles I read when I should actually be writing them.
I am fat of all the tweets I read and realize I have no achievement to write about.

I spend my time contemplating the 9 more users a day I get on my android app, where I should be working on acquiring more by making my app better.
I look at my blog stats everyday when I should be writing new articles.

To make it simple, <strong>I spend way too much time ingesting things, when I should be instead building them</strong>.
I hate myself right now, and I am tired of this. I fell like society is all about getting lazier and lazier, and I hate the fact that I'm biting on it.
So let's start this information diet now. And to make it even more caricatural, end with this quote from <a title="vince lombardi wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vince_Lombardi" target="_blank">Vince Lombardi</a> :

>The difference between a successful person and others is not a lack of strength, not a lack of knowledge, but rather a lack of will.

So may this be a wake-up call, and a reminder that <strong>what really counts is not what you have done in the past, but all the things you have not achieved yet and that you should be working on.</strong>
