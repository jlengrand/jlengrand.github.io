My first post in a loooooong time.

This article has been on my list for long, but for some reason I lost the motivation for writing those last months.
I am gonna try to force myself to get to it again, because I know it does help me feel better about myself.
<br /><br />
I have been increasingly using [Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/) those last two years. I met a lot of great guys in Meetups. Heard lots of inspiring people. Listen to great talks that motivated me trying even harder to be good at what I do.
<br /><br />
One of the meetups I started going to on a regular basis was the [Appsterdam Peer Lab](http://www.meetup.com/Appsterdam/). Meetings happen every Saturday from 9 to 12, in a nice coffee place in Amsterdam.
The idea is simple : get there, and start coding on your projects. Do what you want. And enjoy being around others that can help you if you are stuck.
I really liked this meetups, because it motivated me getting up on Saturday Mornings, and do what I love most : build stuff.
The meetup became some kind of milestone of the week, forcing me to make some progress on this project I want to push out.
<br /><br />
[Appsterdam Peer Lab](http://www.meetup.com/Appsterdam)/ is one of the reasons [Brestram](http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fr.lengrand.brestram&hl=en) is on the app store today, with more than 5k installs and some paying users instead of lying somewhere half baked on my hard drive.
<br /><br />
The only real issue of this meetup was that it takes place in Amsterdam. More than an hour away from my house. Which meant I had to get up at 7.30 on Saturdays to get to it.
That was just a bit too hardcore for me :).
<br /><br />
Not sure what to do next I tried something: Create a similar meetup in the city I live in. [Saturday Morning Coding Utrecht](http://www.meetup.com/Saturday-Morning-Coding-Utrecht/) was born.
I wasn't sure about this. I was thinking for myself : No one is crazy enough to get up at 8 on Saturdays in Utrecht. You won't get anyone, all the cool guys will be in Amsterdam.
<br /><br />
The first weeks, I was anxious. The meetings were really quiet. I was mostly sitting alone in the coffeeshop. But at least I was still pushing on my projects during this time, so I kept going.
<br /><br />
Last month, [Saturday Morning Coding Utrecht](http://www.meetup.com/Saturday-Morning-Coding-Utrecht/) reached its first year of existence. And I love what it brought me.
Slowly, a small community of people started to emerge. **The group is now compozed of more than 130 members**. Last week, we were 11 to join, in the same coffee place. Some [startup communities](http://hollandstartup.com/) or office spaces offered to host us. Some other times, business oriented guys showed up, talking about their projects.
<br /><br />
The meetup is full of activity now, with people interested to hear each others stories.
But there is more to it. **I found real friends there. Guys that I have built projects with, won hackathons with, and that I hope to stay in contact with wherever I go next.**
<br /><br />
**What I get out of this is simple: If the thing you want doesn't exist where you are, try to create it yourself!**
You don't have much to lose, and you never know what it can bring you back.
<br /><br />
Here is to one more year of Saturday Morning Coding Utrecht!
<br /><br />
Cheers,
Julien
