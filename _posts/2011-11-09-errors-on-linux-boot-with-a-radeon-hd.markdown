Hi all,

For the past months, I had a huge issue with My <strong>debian</strong> based system.

I got a  Radeon 5770 graphical card and here are some more information:

{% highlight bash %}
[airballman@crunchbang:~]$ lspci | grep VGA
01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: ATI Technologies Inc Juniper [Radeon HD 5700 Series]
{% endhighlight %}

On startup, I would have 15/20 seconds of errors flooding my boot screen.

Here is the Error log, repeated again and again:

{% highlight bash %}

[drm:radeon_ttm_backend_bind] *ERROR* failed to bind 1 pages at 0x0040F000
[TTM] Couldn't bind backend.
radeon 0000:01:00.0: object_init failed for (4096, 0x00000002)
[drm:radeon_gem_object_create] *ERROR* Failed to allocate GEM object (4096, 2, 4096, -22)

{% endhighlight %}

The problem as quite annoying, even causing<strong> graphical startup failures</strong>. . . I searched a lot for a solution and <a title="cr-fr" href="https://crunchbanglinux-fr.org/forum/viewtopic.php?id=1123" target="_blank">asked for some help</a>.

I tried lots of stuff, from installing new free drivers to the proprietary <strong>ati</strong> solution. The latter solved the problem, but caused<strong> mouse freezes</strong>. . .

After a lot of problems, <a title="darth" href="https://plus.google.com/109434034494027454595" target="_blank">DarthWound</a> finally gave my the good way to solve it !

The problem was coming from <strong><a title="plymouth" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plymouth_(software)" target="_blank">Plymouth</a></strong>, and removing it would remove the error :

{% highlight bash %}

$ sudo apt-get remove plymouth

{% endhighlight %}

The con of this method is that you will lose your beautiful startup image. . .

Let me know if you find a better solution !

You may see the effect on my screen here :
