<p style="text-align: justify;">After almost ten years without a TV, I finally bought a <a title="my TV on amazon" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Samsung-UE40EH5000-40-inch-Widescreen-Freeview/dp/B007IHYP5Y" target="_blank">101cm Samsung</a> last week-end.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Not that I feel the need for it that much, but being in the process of learning dutch I thought it might be a valuable tool.
See, there are not that many dutch movies out there, so the best way to listen to some nederlands at home is probably national TV :).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I bought the simplest TV I could find, without<a title="smart tv wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_TV" target="_blank"> Smart TV</a> or any tuner in it. But with such a screen, installing some kind of media server was now mandatory :D.
So I installed the last version of <a title="xbmcbuntu" href="http://wiki.xbmc.org/index.php?title=XBMCbuntu" target="_blank"><strong>Xbmcbuntu</strong> </a>on an old laptop that was sleeping on a shelf for a year and connected it on my screen through HDMI.
Within 30 minutes, the distribution was installed and running fine. Ten minutes more and I had the <strong>remote control</strong> installed and set up on my android and could throw the mouse away.
Next step was to get an<strong> add-on to use Spotify</strong>, which was also really simple to find. My choice went to <strong><a title="spotimc" href="https://github.com/mazkolain/spotimc" target="_blank">Spotimc</a>. </strong>Just download the zip, put it on your media server and you're basically done.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I had no experience at all with media server in the past, and I must say that<strong> I am really impressed</strong> how well thought the whole thing can be.
When adding movies to the library, <strong>xbmc</strong> will automatically download the subtitles and covers for it. Better than that, it will display them nicely in the background as you browse through your library!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I already know which project I'll donate to next month :).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And as a bonus, here are some pictures to convert you too :)</p>
