    mex C files?\r\nThanks again"

    succeed into using it ? \r\n\r\nI posted this code some time ago now, but I do
    recall having to compile it. \r\nIt seems weird for me to download each file separately

Hi all,

I am currently working on a <strong>Computer Vision</strong> application which requires a step of <strong>shape recognition</strong>. And I have been searching for lots of different parameters allowing to precisely classify objects afterwards.

In a lot of applications, one need parameters that are invariant to <strong><a title="linear transformation" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_map" target="_blank">linear transformations</a></strong> (that is translation, rotation and scaling) to ease object <strong>classification</strong> in various conditions.

If you search for such parameters, you will quickly hear the name of <strong><a title="zernike moments" href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/CVonline/LOCAL_COPIES/SHUTLER3/node11.html" target="_blank">Zernicke</a></strong> and <strong><a title="hu" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_moment" target="_blank">Hu</a> </strong>moments.  Here are links to a <strong>Matlab</strong> implementation of those descriptors:
<ul>
	<li><strong><a href="http://murphylab.web.cmu.edu/publications/boland/thesis_all.html" target="_blank">Zernike</a></strong> applied to protein localization</li>
	<li><strong><a href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~kwatra/computer_vision/ocr/OCR.html" target="_blank">Hu</a> </strong>applied to <a title="ocr" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition" target="_blank">OCR</a></li>
</ul>
<div id="post-body-5906015610342128589">

Have fun using it, but don't forget to mention their previous authors ;).

And if you need more descriptors in your classification, <a title="visual descriptors" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_descriptors" target="_blank"><strong>here is a quite exhaustive list</strong> </a>(at least as much as it can be).

If I have some spare time, I might think of a Pythonic implementation one day ^^. I'll let you know.

Hope you'll enjoy ;)

See You
