Hi all,

Sorry but all the syntax highlighting of my blog seems to be broken.

I think it comes from my plugin,Â <strong>SyntaxHighlighter Evolved, </strong>and I'm working to find the issue.

Sorry for the inconvenience, I hope to find a solution soon !

&nbsp;

EDIT : Problem is (half) solved.

I found the root cause : another plugin I installed yesterday : Jetpack with a misplaced tag.

&nbsp;

Now I'll need some more time to fix the issue :)
