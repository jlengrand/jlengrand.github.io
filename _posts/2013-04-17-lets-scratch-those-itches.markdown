<p style="text-align: justify;">It's been a long time since I have written stuff regularly on this blog. But it doesn't mean nothing happened; <a title="my github" href="http://github.com/jlengrand?tab=repositories" target="_blank">far from that in fact!</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For some strange reason, blogging is just like sport : <strong>the less you practice the less you want to get back in</strong>.
Put some holidays in the middle and you quickly end up in a situation where your blog lies dead for weeks even though you have plenty of ideas of articles.
And after some time, you don't even have ideas any more; which makes it even more difficult to get back on rails.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I don't know about you, but thinking about it I can often see a relation between the number of blog posts I write and the progress I make in my pet projects. <strong>Just like if blogging was some kind of motivator to work harder</strong>, or somehow linked to my productivity as a developer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Blog posts are difficult for me to write. As a<a title="bad developer" href="http://www.guynirpaz.com/2012/06/11/good-developer-bad-developer/" target="_blank"> (bad)</a> developer, I love to directly jump into the technical stuff. And I really have to force myself to take a step back and spend an hour or two writing about something I have already done. In the end,<strong> most of the blog post ideas I got</strong> end up in the trash bin and<strong> never get published.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But thinking about this, I realized that I actually write a lot. Only of all this is never actually goes on the internet.
For years, there are two things I always have on me :</p>

<ul>
	<li>My glasses, just because otherwise I couldn't see anything (don't try to make a link with the post, there's none)</li>
	<li>And <strong>a notebook with a pen</strong>, in which I write everyday.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This habit has been here as long as I can remember.
<a title="handle knowledge" href="http://www.lengrand.fr/2012/03/efficiently-handle-knowledge-as-a-computer-scientist/" target="_blank"><strong>I know I have a really bad memory</strong></a>. I always had. So noting down stuff is the best way for me to cope with this brain full of holes.
Those last years, I started also writing down everything that could piss me off. Things that would take me a long time to do while I could avoid it. Or things that I would see people do that I sound could be done better (at least in my opinion).
Those are just dummy statements on my notebook, but I usually put them somewhere else afterwards and sometimes give more thoughts about it.
And when I started reading <a title="HN" href="http://news.ycombinator.com/" target="_blank">Hacker News</a> and <a title="life hacker" href="http://lifehacker.com/recommended" target="_blank">LifeHacker </a>a few months ago, I actually realized that <strong>some of these dummy ideas have actually been transformed into sustainable businesses by clever people.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So instead of writing them to myself, I think I will start putting them out on this blog. Let's not call them business ideas (most are likely not to be) but simply itch scratchers, or life facilitators :).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the end, I think I should have done this long in the past :</p>

<ul>
	<li>If anyone has the same ideas than me and read them here, Fine! That can be seen as some kinf of validation for him :)</li>
	<li>It will force me to develop those ideas a bit more, to make them understandable by everyone.</li>
	<li>It will allow me to post on this blog without more work than usual, as I already write those for myself usually.</li>
	<li><strong><em id="__mceDel" style="text-align: justify;"><em id="__mceDel"><em id="__mceDel">And who knows, maybe will someone fall in love with one these ideas and contact me to make it happen!.</em></em></em></strong></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So now, let's make this happen!</p>
