Some of you might already have heard about <strong><a title="the pirate patch" href="https://elite.so/tpp/" target="_blank">The Pirate Patch</a></strong> (at least those who read <strong><a title="korben" href="https://korben.info/le-pirate-patch.html" target="_blank">Korben</a></strong>).

For several months now, the pirate bay is <a title="piratebay blocked" href="https://www.t-mobile.nl/sorry" target="_blank">blocked in several countries such as Belgium or the Netherlands</a>.
<strong>Qarizma</strong>, a member of the <strong><a title="elite.so" href="https://elite.so/" target="_blank">elite.so</a></strong> website has developed a small utility to get around this problem. The script uses reverse-proxy on some of the mirrors of the pirate bay that are not blocked. Basically, it simply modified your host file.

I downloaded the patch and wanted to give it a try. But it is developed in <a title="windows shell" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(computing)" target="_blank">windows shell</a> and thus is <strong>only Windows compatible.</strong>

So last night, I simply looked at the source and developed <strong><a title="piratepatch in Python" href="https://gist.github.com/334576c898c0cd727075" target="_blank">a Python equivalent</a></strong>. This way everybody with a Python interpreter should be able to use it.

I packaged it into an executable and tried it successfully on Windows and Linux. I wait this week-end to get access to a Mac and be sure it works on all OSes.

If so, you may find it soon next to the windows version, on the <a title="elite.so" href="https://elite.so/" target="_blank">elite.so</a> website.
Hope this will help some of you :)
