Not so long ago, this blog was powered by <strong><a title="pluxml" href="http://www.pluxml.org/">PluXml</a></strong>, a complete CMS that has the great advantage of running without any database.
You can learn a bit more about my experience of Pluxml in one of<strong><a title="pluxml post" href="http://www.lengrand.fr/2012/01/a-lightweight-dynamic-cms-database-free/" target="_blank"> my last posts.</a></strong>

My design was based on two main objectives : <strong>dark colors</strong> and <strong>minimalism</strong>.
I never really liked fancy colors and hate to find them in websites. I think I succeded, and you can find the result on <a title="pluxml test platform" href="http://pluxml.lengrand.fr" target="_blank">this test platform</a>.
Here is a screenshots of of the main page :

<center><a href="{{ site.url }}/images/posts/2012/01/pluxml_theme.jpeg"><img class="size-large wp-image-502" title="pluxml_theme" src="{{ site.url }}/images/posts/2012/01/pluxml_theme-1024x617.jpg" alt="my dark pluxml theme" width="584" height="351" /></a></center>

The theme is based on two main colors : dark gray/black for the background and light grey for the foreground part. Web links are in colors in order to give some highlighting on the page.
The structure is divided into three main parts:
<ul>
	<li>The header section, which is dedicated to present the different parts of my work. This can be my pictures collection, my programming tips or my github repository.</li>
	<li>The sidebar section on the right, where are listed the ways you can use to find me on the web and some more information about the blog. This means the n last published articles and a list of my social network profiles.</li>
	<li>Finally, the central part contains static pages and articles.</li>
</ul>
This theme is strict XHTML 1.0 compliant as it passes the W3C validator without error neither warnings.

Feel free to use it, the last version can be downloaded on <strong><a title="github theme" href="https://github.com/jlengrand/pluxml_theme_darkFuture" target="_blank">my github</a></strong> or in <a title="pluxml theme ressources" href="http://ressources.pluxml.org/?theme126/theme-dark-future" target="_blank">pluxml ressources</a>.
