Hi all,

I am currently working on reducing the number of technologies used on my website. After having removed loads of plugins ( I just kept the essential database backup and cache enhancement), I also chose to switch to a full english blog.

The next step is the removal of the old <strong>programming tips</strong> page using <a title="tiddly" href="http://www.tiddlywiki.fr/">tiddlywiki</a>. You can find the new one <strong><a title="Programming Tips" href="http://www.lengrand.fr/programming-tips-2/">here</a></strong>.

The only language for now is <strong>Bash</strong>, but more should come soon.

Hope this can help some of you.

C ya, and enjoy your holidays (for the lucky guys :s).

EDIT : There it is, all sections are back up. Check it out <strong><a title="Programming Tips" href="http://www.lengrand.fr/programming-tips-2/">here</a></strong> !
