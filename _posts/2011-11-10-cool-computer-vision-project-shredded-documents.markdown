Hi all,

Today I just wanted you to know about the <strong><a href="http://www.shredderchallenge.com/">DARPA Shredder Challenge</a></strong>.

This challenge aims at <strong>reconstructing shredded documents</strong>, and the contest run till the 5th December.

You may use whatever technique you want to reconstruct the original message, but of course<strong> Image Processing algorithms</strong> are greatly favorized !

There are 5 levels in the challenge, growing more and more difficult.Â Unfortunately, the <strong>50,000$ price</strong> is only available to US citizens. . . But the real fuel is the challenge, isn't it?

And you, would you try to solve some of the puzzles? Let me know about your ideas !

I know this issue has already been investigated in the past for Stasi documents (see <a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2008/01/unshredding_1.html">here</a> and <a href="http://www.iiconservation.org/news/?p=55">here</a>).
