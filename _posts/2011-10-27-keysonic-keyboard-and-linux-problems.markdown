After having moved to my new flat last year, I bought a new computer to replace the old laptop I kept during my studies. And to fit with my neon tubes I chose a blue backlight keybord from Keysonic, the <a href="http://www.maxpoint.de/de/products/keyboards.php?pid=1_3_7&amp;we_objectID=1219">KSX-6001</a> .

Running Windows, no problem. The keyboard is just what I wanted, allowing fast typing with its rough keys. I am really happy with it.

But running Linux, impossible to get the keyboard working. . . I could use it during the <strong>Grub</strong> and it was correctly detected by <strong>lsusb</strong>, but impossible to use it after loading the <strong>kernel</strong>.

I mailed the customer service from Keysonic and got an answer the very day after :

The keyboard embeds a "gaming mode" that is designed to forbid ghost keys. And this mode it not functional on UNIX systems, it has to be deactivated on startup.

<ul>
	<li>Deactivation : <strong>ctrl+alt+shift+n</strong></li>
	<li>Activation : <strong>ctrl+alt+shift+g</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusion :</h2>
<ul>
	<li>This Keysonic keyboard is simply awesome. It allows fast typing while being quite cheap (less than 20 euros). Huge bonus : Customer service is nice and reactive.</li>
	<li>I got a free bonus <strong>security mode</strong> for my computer :D. It was not expected, but strangers won't be able to use my keyboard without knowing the tip :D</li>
</ul>
This is really awesome :p

See ya ;)
