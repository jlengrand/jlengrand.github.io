A really quick tip today : I am completely fond of <strong><a title="Llama" href="https://www.appbrain.com/app/llama-location-profiles/com.kebab.Llama" target="_blank">Llama </a></strong>on my Android phone.

<center><img title="Llama application" src="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B4bXocpgiAyxTklldHNIYU8tOGc" alt="Llama application icon " width="705" height="345" /></center>

Actually, it the very first application I would install on a new device.

Taken from the Android market, Here is Llama description :
<blockquote>Phone going off at night? Annoying your colleagues at work? Get Llama!

Tired of your phone buzzing in the middle of the night? Annoying your colleagues by having your phone blast out your ringtone at work? You need Llama!</blockquote>
Basically, Llama detects where you are (home, work, whatever) and automatically changes your current phone settings. As an example, I use it a lot to move to plane mode at night, or activate wifi to save data while <a title="Job Space" href="https://www.lengrand.fr/job-space/" target="_blank">at work</a>.

For some time, I was having a lot of problems with my Llama profiles.It would change me to home while on my way to work, or keep the wifi off even at night, . . .I was about to drop the app and search for an alternative when I finally found the solution.

In the <a title="event tab" href="https://www.google.com/imgres?um=1&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=N&amp;authuser=0&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=995&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbnid=LgoY7Jb_yjZrLM:&amp;imgrefurl=https://howto.cnet.com/8301-11310_39-20065425-285/how-to-automate-android-volume-settings-based-on-location/&amp;docid=PhQJ8J1sGQSyjM&amp;imgurl=https://i.i.com.com/cnwk.1d/i/tim/2011/05/23/Llama_standard_Events_tab_270x450.png&amp;w=270&amp;h=450&amp;ei=4HzYT-fEI8_m8QOXw8iqCg&amp;zoom=1&amp;iact=rc&amp;dur=593&amp;sig=103926703585630384990&amp;page=1&amp;tbnh=153&amp;tbnw=90&amp;start=0&amp;ndsp=53&amp;ved=1t:429,r:0,s:0,i:75&amp;tx=34&amp;ty=59" target="_blank">Events tab</a>, I added a new condition to my important profile (Labelled as <strong>At. . .</strong> ).In <strong>Advanced options </strong>of the selected <strong>Event</strong>, select <strong>Repeat Event</strong> and <strong>choose an interval of time</strong>.

That's it. Solved all my problems. Hope some will find this useful!
